    <div class="para">

        <p  style="font-size: large; color: aliceblue;"><br>The evolution of cars has been a long and fascinating one. The first cars were steam-powered, but they were not very efficient or practical. In the late 1800s, gasoline-powered cars began to emerge, and they quickly became more popular. The Ford Model T, introduced in 1908, was the first mass-produced car, and it made cars affordable for the average person. 
            
            In the early 1900s, cars began to become more sophisticated. They were equipped with new features such as windshields, headlights, and turn signals. Cars also became more powerful and luxurious. In the 1970s, the oil crisis led to a focus on fuel-efficient cars. In the 1980s, Japanese cars became increasingly popular in the United States.
            
            In the 1990s, computers and electronics became increasingly common in cars. This led to the development of new features such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, and navigation systems. In the 2000s, hybrid and electric cars became more popular, as concerns about the environment grew. In the 2010s, self-driving cars were developed, but they are not yet widely available.
            
            The evolution of cars is a story of innovation and progress. As technology advances, we can expect to see even more innovative and groundbreaking developments in the automotive industry in the years to come. <br></p>
